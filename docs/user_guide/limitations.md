# Limitations #
SLYR will always follow development in both software to provide conversion opportunities as they arise, but if an ability is available in one and not the other, then this conversion is limited. But don't be disheartened, if the ability is in ESRI, we can always develop it within QGIS. The other way around though - well that is out of our hands. 

To be transparent, we have listed the current limitations that we know of, what we are doing about it and if there is a workaround in the meantime. 
>If you know a limitation that isn't listed, please [email us](info@north-road.com) and we will investigate it. 
## Rule-Based Classification Symbology ##
One of our favourites features of **QGIS** Symbology is the ability to create efficient cartography through the use of Rule-Based classifications. There is currently no direct equivalent in ArcGIS Pro. Therefore, if your **QGIS** project has many layers based on rule-based classifications, try this for a workaround. 
> Painful yes - but let's manually capture the rule-based classification in the layer's  field.
