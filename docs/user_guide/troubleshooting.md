# Troubleshooting #
## Reinstall my SLYR Plugin ##
If you have changed machines, you may need to reinstall the **SLYR** Plugin. 

1. Navigate to the SLYR Plugin folder you were sent. 

2. Grab the .py and drag and drop it over your QGIS. 

3. Open the `QGIS Plugin Manager`

## Update my SLYR licence ##

## Add in SVG files ##
If you have access to the SVG files you need, and you find that SLYR is not bringing them in, check to see if the location is listed in the `Settings` ▶️ `Options` ▶️  `SVG Paths`.
