# Troubleshooting #
## Reinstall my SLYR Plugin ##
If you have changed machines, you may need to reinstall the **SLYR** Plugin. 

1. Navigate to the SLYR Plugin folder you were sent. 

2. Grab the .py and drag and drop it over your QGIS. 

3. Open the `QGIS Plugin Manager`

## Update my SLYR licence ##
**SLYR** is updated regularly and **QGIS** will let you know when a new version has been released. To update your version:

1. Open the **Plugin Manager**, click on the top menu item `Plugins` ▶️ `Manage and Install Plugins`.

2. In the left panel, click on `Upgradeable` and `SLYR` should be in the middle panel. If it isn't, then you should be up-to-date. 
> Check-out what has been updated in the *Changelog*.

3. On the lower right, click on `Upgrade Plugin`. Once upgraded, click on `Close`.

## Add in SVG files ##
If you have access to the SVG files you need, and you find that SLYR is not bringing them in, check to see if the location is listed in the `Settings` ▶️ `Options` ▶️  `SVG Paths`.
