## Cost of SLYR Plugin ##
At the time of writing, to purchase the SLYR Plugin costs â‚¬1200. For those sitting outside of Europe, the cost will be as per the conversion rate at the time of issuing the invoice. 

## How many users will a licence cover ##
The **SLYR** licence agreement covers use by mulitple users in the same physical location. It will also cover remote users that are attached to the defined physical location. If you have multiple locations that require use of the licence, please let us know and we will assess each case on an individual basis. 

## Purchase process ##
If you would like to to purchase SLYR send us an email. As we often deal with with clients in Europe and America, there is often a lag due to the time differences as we are in Queensland, Australia. To speed up the process, include the details below in your email so we can produce an invoice for you straight away. If you need a quote first, we still need the same details and let us know you require a quote. 

To create this invoice, we require the following information:
- Organisation name/Your name
- Office address
- VAT number (if in Europe)
- Purchase order number if required
- Expected number of users
- Type of users (in office/remote)

When we have received this information, we will send you an invoice.

When we receive payment (credit card, bank transfer or PayPal), we will send you the licence and instructions for using **SLYR**.

## Student versions ##
Unfortunately we do not offer a student version of **SLYR**. We recommend you approach your institution to purchase **SLYR**. 

## Support ##
North Road offers a high level of support to all **SLYR** purchases. You can contact us at anytime via [email](mailto:info@north-road.com). 
- If there is a bug we will fix it to the best of our abilities and release it as soon as we can. 
- If you wish a tool to work in a certain way, and if there are no barriers to developing it (software constraints in QGIS/ESRI), we will attempt to do it. 
- If it is something that will require a high level of development, you can consider whether to join the current **Hall of Fame** and sponsor its development.

## Trial versions ##
Evaluation versions of the tool are not available. If you require a sample conversions prior to purchasing, email QGIS or ESRI files to [North Road Support](mailto:info@north-road.com) for conversion and we will email back the results to you for your evaluation. 
For each conversion, send through these files

| Source | File type to send |
| ------ | :----------------- |
| ESRI | .aprx, .mapx, .mxd |
| QGIS | .qgs .qgz |

## Version updates  ##
SLYR is updated many times during the year, at least once per quarter. To find out what has been updated in the latest version, check out the changelog in the `QGIS Plugin Manager`

## What licences do I need? ##
SLYR is designed so that you can push out ESRI products without the need of an ESRI licence as you operate **SLYR** from **QGIS**. You only need to have [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) installed. However, if you wish to view the output in an ESRI environment, you will need an appropriate type of licence for the file type. For more information on files types and the software needed, check out [Fileformat's GIS list](https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/).

## What QGIS version do I need? ##
The latest QGIS version is always the best as we update SLYR to meet the latest versions. However, SLYR will work with older versions - we recommend using at least v3.16.
