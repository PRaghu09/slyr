## What licences do I need? ##
SLYR is designed so that you can push out ESRI products without the need of an ESRI licence as you operate **SLYR** from **QGIS**. You only need to have [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) installed. However, if you wish to view the output in an ESRI environment, you will need an appropriate type of licence for the file type. For more information on files types and the software needed, check out [Fileformat's GIS list](https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/).

## What QGIS version do I need? ##
The latest QGIS version is always the best as we update SLYR to meet the latest versions. However, SLYR will work with older versions - we recommend using at least v3.16.

## SLYR trial versions ##
Evaluation versions of the tool are not available. If you require a sample conversions prior to purchasing, email QGIS or ESRI files to [North Road Support](mailto:info@north-road.com) for conversion and we will email back the results to you for your evaluation. 
For each conversion, send through these files

| Source | File type to send |
| ------ | :----------------- |
| ESRI | .aprx, .mapx, .mxd |
| QGIS | .qgs .qgz |

## SLYR version updates  ##
SLYR is updated many times during the year, at least once per quarter. To find out what has been updated in the latest version, check out the changelog in the `QGIS Plugin Manager`
