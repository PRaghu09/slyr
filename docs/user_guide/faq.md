## What licences do I need? ##
SLYR is designed so that you can push out ESRI products without the need of an ESRI licence. You only need to have [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) installed.

## What QGIS version do I need? ##
The latest QGIS version is always the best as we update SLYR to meet the latest versions. However, SLYR will work with older versions - we recommend using at least v3.16.

## SLYR trial versions ##
