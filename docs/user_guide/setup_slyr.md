# Set-up SLYR #
<!-- it would be nice to only give access to this page to purchasers -->

## Install the plugin ##
Once purchased, users will receive an email from North Road with a link for the installer and their licence key. 

1. Download the installer from the link

2. Unzip the downloaded file, and then drag the extracted "install_slyr_qgis.py" over an open QGIS window. (If prompted, accept the warning regarding trusted scripts). The script will add a connection to the private plugins repository, and install the SLYR plugin for you.

3. After the plugin is installed, the SLYR options dialog will open. Enter your unique license key at this screen, exactly as it appears at the end of this email. Enter the optional requirements outlined in the *SLYR Options* section below.
